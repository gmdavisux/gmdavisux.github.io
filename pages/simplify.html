      <h1>Simplified install</h1>
      <p class="small">Kodak Alaris | Lead Design | 2015</p>
      <p>Kodak Alaris makes high speed scanning systems for data processing. I needed to simplify the install process.</p>
      <h2>Documenting the Current State</h2>
      <p>One of the first things I did at Kodak
        Alaris was to get myself an unopened scanner in a box and document the installation process. The onboarding
        process involved clicking thru 57 screens of info regarding adresses, phone, number of employees, revenue, and
        more.</p>
      <img src="images/ka-installer/ka-install58steps.jpg" class="img-fluid " alt="Description of the image">
      <p>I started to ask what the information was needed for. I was directed to marketing.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Marketing told me they dont use the info. Ask Sales.
        </li>
        <li>Sales told me they don't use it. Ask Support.</li>
        <li>
          Support assured me they get all their info on each phone call.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>After I was able to demonstrate that the information was being collected
        and stored for nobody, I was able to convince the team we dodn't need it.</p>

      <h2>Benchmarking</h2>
      <p>Next I started looking for the best in class installation processes. There were a few that stood out.</p>
      <h4>Bose Speakers</h4>
      <p>Bose wireless speaker sytems use an app to find new devices, then easily add them to your network in about 6
        steps.</p>

      <h2>The Design Work</h2>
      <p>With CDs becoming less common, and some government customers without inetrrnet, I proposed we include a stable
        version of the software install on the device. Using a trick I learned from benchmarking, we can create a local
        network via wire or wifi from the device. From there we can 'bootstrap' the connection to the device and download the software.
      </p>
      <p>We had different versions dependingon the type of PC (wired or wirelss networking) and the type of scanner wired or wireless connection. </p>
