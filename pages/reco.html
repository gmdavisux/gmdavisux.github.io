                        <p>Gary is a singularly skilled individual. He is the most thorough and thoughtful user interface designer I&apos;ve had the honor to work with in my career.</p>
                        <p>He has a truly impressive ability to take a a set of technical requirements and programmer-produced functionally-designed interface mockups, internalize the rationale behind each of those components and then extrapolate from that a human-centric design that leaps the great chasm from merely functional to truly usable.</p>
                        <p>I would be thrilled to work with Gary again on any design project whether it be a door handle or a jet cockpit.</p>

                        <p> As a colleague most recently, I have seen his mixed background in Industrial design, Interaction design and Human Factors bring a depth and quality to work, that few can offer. His broad interests in everything from web design to cell phones make him a great resource as well. His skill on both Macintosh as well as PCs, more than once helped me solve an issue. I really canâ€™t say enough about how much he knows, due to his own interests in researching topics that interest him.</p>
                        <p>In a nutshell Gary knows how to do a lot of things and has the professionalism to carry them out to perfection.</p>

                        <p>Gary and I worked closely together at Xerox. He is a superb user interaction designer. He is attentive to both the big picture (e.g., user experience architecture and logical design) and the details (e.g., widgets and graphics). He is truly creative and innovative in his approach to human-machine interaction design.</p>
