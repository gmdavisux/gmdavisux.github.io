            <p class="small">Dell Technologies | Design Lead, study planning | 2012</p>
            <p>The Dell K3000 Mobile Device Management Appliance was a groundbreaking server-appliance designed to
                streamline the management of mobile devices and their software, such as phones and tablets, across an
                organization.
            </p>
            <p>As the lead designer for this project, I was responsible for overseeing the workflow and design
                decisions, collaborating closely with a cross-functional team comprising a graphic designer, user
                researcher, project manager, and developers.</p>
            <h2>Comprehensive Device Management</h2>
            <p>This powerful appliance empowered administrators with a comprehensive suite of capabilities to monitor
                and control their fleet of mobile devices effectively. From pushing software updates and security
                patches to enforcing corporate policies and locating misplaced or stolen devices, the K3000 offered a
                centralized command center for managing the entire mobile device lifecycle.</p>
            <h2>Simple but powerful search</h2>
            <img src="images/image-5.jpeg?w=1024" alt=""
                class="img-fluid border mb-3">
            <p>One of the standout features of the K3000 was its intuitive search functionality. Designed to be flexible
                and user-friendly, the search allowed administrators to perform freeform typing and instantly presented
                categorized matches. This enabled them to build customized lists by either requiring (is) or excluding
                (is not) specific items, streamlining the process of locating and managing devices or applications.</p>

                class="img-fluid border mb-3">
            <p>The appliance featured a dedicated screen that provided administrators with a comprehensive overview of
                all applications installed across their fleet of devices, spanning both iOS and Android platforms. From
                this centralized hub, they could seamlessly push updates, manage settings, and maintain consistent
                application deployment across their entire mobile device ecosystem.</p>

            <h2>Static Mockups: Visualizing the Concepts</h2>
            <p>In the early stages of the project, static mockups played a crucial role in communicating and refining
                the design concepts. These initial layout drawings served as a foundation for discussions, iterations,
                and collaborative decision-making, ensuring that the final product met the needs of both administrators
                and end-users.</p>

            <h2>Customer Study</h2>
        </div> <!-- // col -->
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>During development some customers were offered an early preview release to participate in our study. The objectives of this study were to review a subset of release 1.1 features with customers and have them
                perform tasks using specific functionalities, including Smart labels, User roles, SSL certificates,
                Updates, and Volume purchase. The aim was to assess whether customers could find and use these features
                effectively, as well as gather their suggestions for improvement and identify any missing elements.</p>
            <p>The methodology involved seven participants, all current K3000 owners, in a study conducted from June
                26-28,
                2013. Each participant engaged in a one-hour session, which was recorded. The study utilized a hybrid
                approach, combining a usability study where participants first attempted tasks, followed by an open
                conversation about the features. This method allowed for both practical assessment and in-depth
                discussion
                of the new release features. </p>

            <h4>Highlights</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>In general, participants liked the new improvements. They especially liked the ability to delete
                    profiles</li>
                <li>Creating labels was also popular with those who had a need for it </li>
                <li>In many areas of the UI, it was difficult to read text because it was a light grey on a grey. Also, active options looked greyed out and not clickable. As a response, we increased the contrast in specific regions.</li>
                <li>While creating user roles was ranked high as a new feature, several participants wanted more
                    granularity to the access controls associated with user roles</li>
                <li>The added SSL certificate features were very popular, especially being able to generate a new
                    certificate right from the K3000</li>
                <li>Volume purchase was appreciated by those who said they might use it</li>
