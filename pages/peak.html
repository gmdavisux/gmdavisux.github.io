        <h1>Peak Productivity</h1>
            <p>EagleView creates mapping and measurement products from high-resolution aerial photos. However, they need human beings to review many thousands of images to check for focus, cloud-cover, and other anomalies. Their current system was labor intensive and caused burnout and employee pain. I was hired to fix that.</p>

            <h2 class="">Legacy Design</h2>
            <p>Existing software was laborious and clunky. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Controls were a series of small, unlabeled icons</li>
                    <li>Images wwwere displayed in the order of the computer byte blocks</li>
                    <li>Adjacent images were rarely next to each other.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2 class="">New Design</h2>
            <p>The new design vastly accelerated the most common tasks and automated others. Selecting images and adding tags is faster and more standardized.</p>

            <h2 class="">RESEARCH: Understanding the User needs</h2>
            <p>I shadowed and interviewed several current Geomatics QC technicians to understand their job and current workflow. I learned a lot about their work and identified several ways a new design could speed their process. I showed them early versions of the design for their input as well.</p>
            <p>Technicians did needed different information at different stages of their work. </p>
            <ul>
            <li>They only needed the file name if selecting an image. Otherwise it takes up valuable space</li>
            <li>Likewise, metadata is relevant only in certain diagnostic situations.</li>
            <li>Less than 1% of images are viewed enlarged but any image may be chosen. </li>
            <li>Images with anomalies may need further review but they were difficult to locate when mixed within the full image set.</li>
            <li>Technicians very quickly visually scanned images for anomalies. </li>
            <li>They needed not only to reject these images but to mark the reason for the rejection. </li>
            <li>Marking images with problems such as cloud-cover, focus, or oil-on-lens would involve selecting multiple images one at a time and required several clicks to reject and note the reason.</li>
            <li>Finding images with problems such as cloud-cover, focus, or oil-on-lens would involve selecting multiple images one at a time and required several clicks to reject and note the reason.</li>
            <li>Images were previously in a random order based on memory blocks. This made it inefficient to select adjacent images with the same cloud-cover for instance.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="">Innovations</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>I determined that if they’re arranged by each of 6 cameras and time stamp, the images would now be in a spatially adjacent grid making it easy to select groups.</li>
            <li>Sometimes a camera problem would eliminate a series of images. With images randomly placed, manual selection was difficult. Now the entire camera (column) could be selected easily for comment or rejection.</li>
            <li>Time stamp also allowed selection across rows with similar advantages.</li>
            <li>Selecting the “line” selects a large group related to the motion of the aerial cameras, also useful for certain anomalies. </li>
            <li>Tags are created by the QC community. When user types a tag, it becomes part of the autocomplete menu. </li>
            <li>Once tagged, images would also be sorted into tabs for later review.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="">Selecting columns, rows, and lines</h2>
            <p>Users can easily select single images, rows, columns or lines (common tasks in image QC).</p>

            <p>The homepage gives a visual overview of all the active surveys ready for QC. Color and tooltips would denote the current status of the survey. Tabs helped to sort but user and current status.</p>

            <h2 class="">Code help</h2>
            <p>Sometimes I needed to devise solutions to developer problems so the design would get implemented as designed. I did this as a way to help expand the teams capacity. </p>
