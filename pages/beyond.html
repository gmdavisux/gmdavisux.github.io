            <p class="small">Xerox | Design Lead | 2006</p>
            <p>Originally I was asked to simply create graphics for a printer monitoring app. I started asking questions
                to discover the actual problem this was solving.</p>
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>I learned that it was difficult to get resellers interested in carrying Xerox products because of small
                margins and no guarantee of future sales of lucrative supplies. The real problem was making it easy for
                customers to order from resellers.</p>

            <h2>Innovation</h2>
            <p>I went beyond the original scope of the project and proposed an end-to-end system that not only notifies
                the user when supplies are low but also directs the purchase to the original vendor.</p>
            <p>This was all done using existing infrastructure in a novel way that required no configuration by the user
                or vendor. When the software solution was announced in Europe, it generated enthusiastic interest from
                vendors and promises to help drive third-party distribution of new products.</p>

            <h2>Process Flow</h2>
            <p>The "Order Supplies" link within the status monitor launches a background application that will open
                a link to a Xerox URL in the user's browser.</p>
            <p>Encoded in the URL query are the device serial number and other data.</p>
            <p>The Xerox web server looks up the reseller based on the data in the URL and redirects the user to the
                reseller&rsquo;s site.</p>
            <p>To the user, the background app and redirection are invisible steps. From their view, they clicked
                and ended up at the seller&rsquo;s site.</p>

            <p>The original reseller's website opens with a list of Xerox part numbers for their printer above. The
                vendor can choose to parse the URL and display a product specific page.</p>

                    printer is running low on ink or toner. The app recognizes which specific printer you have and
                    identifies the store it was purchased from. It then guides you straight to that seller, creating
                    a seamless connection between your printer's needs and the original vendor, without any hassle
                    or guesswork.
