            <p>I designed this entire report but the Total Solar Resource Fraction views of the roof were a 
                particularly interesting visual communication problem.</p>
            <p>Eagleview wanted to create a product solar installers could use to determine the best year-round
                placement of solar panels. Showing this visually seemed straightforward, but presented unexpected challenges.</p>
            <h2>New design</h2>
            <p>The new report was designed to show solar contractors and their customers the best placement
                of solar panels for maximum efficiency year-round. The initial version was a printed document with the
                web version to follow.</p>

            <h3 class="">Research</h3>
            <p>In order to get the visualizations right, I tested several different color schemes by asking participants
                to tell me where the sunniest part of the roof was.</p>
            <p>Below are some early concept sketches of the new design. </p>

            <h4 class="pt-2">Multi-color</h4>
            <p>It would seem at first that using discrete colors to represent different ranges of solar irradiance
                would be best. However, testing showed almost half of the participants were unable to determine
                which color was the brightest.</p>

            <h4 class="pt-2">Adjacent warm colors</h4>
            <p>Continuing the experiment, I tried a transition between adjacent colors.</p>
            <p>The problem is some people reversed which shade is “hottest” <i>despite the fact that this appeared with
                    a labeled key</i>. I intended the lightest color to be the sunniest.</p>

            <h4 class="pt-2">Monochromatic</h4>
            <p>A breakthrough happened when I began to think of areas of darkness rather than sunlight. The result was a
                more monochromatic heat map.</p>
            <p>I used blue because it can appear both light and dark, clearly conveying shadow and light. This
                communicates the best and user testing showed this. I also tried other monochromatic colors but blues
                worked the best.</p>

    <h4 class="pt-2">Gridlock</h4>
    <p>Next we added a square-foot grid to the roof to aid in measurement. Unfortunately, the lines made the
     blue look darker and drab.</p>

    <h4 class="pt-2">Dot to dot</h4>
    <p>Taking inspiration from my sketchbook grid, I changed the line-grid to a dot-grid where the intersection
     of lines formed a dot. The dots had less of an effect on the color perceptions. Now the colors were
     coming through cleaner.</p>
