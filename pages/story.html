                <h3>LOTS of Reading</h3>
                <p>The old design had hundreds of individual checks, each with individual controls that required users to manipulate each one at a time. The list was so large that the user needed to scroll to see the extent and severity of the problems.</p>

            <p>User interviews revealed: </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Customers hated the long list they needed to carefully check for fear of missing something. </li>
            <li>They also had no idea if the problems were getting worse of how long issues had persisted. </li>
            <li>Finally, they needed a way to act on problems at scale, not one at a time. </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="">Telling a Story with Design</h2>
            <p>The new design offers several enhancements providing progressive disclosure and manipulation at scale:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Filters allow the inclusion of vendors or user-defined tags to further focus the data.</li>
            <li>Small bars above each tab allow a preview of the severity of issues in each category.</li>
            <li>A historical trend chart shows a visual history of the selected issues.</li>
            <li>Each severity level is collapsed into a summary view with a graphic and numeric overview.</li>
            <li>A control bar allows manipulation of multiple items at scale.</li>
            </ul>
