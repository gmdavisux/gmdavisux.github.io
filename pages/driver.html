      <h2>Handling Constraints</h2>
      <p>One of the common problems in interaction
        design involves the handling of constraints. One
        user selection might prevent another selection
        from functioning or produce unintended results.
        For example: Selecting stapling as a finishing
        option, while collate is turned off will produce
        results that are most likely NOT what the user
        wanted. </p>

      <h3>Patented Constraint Handling Strategy</h3>
      <p>There are many acceptable methods to handle constraints. The approach I used in the CentreWare Print Drivers
        was three fold. </p>
      <p>First I tried to "design-out" constraints. Some features were combined. For example: "Collated", "Collated,
        Stapled" and "Uncollated" all appear in the same control. Combining some features when practical is a way to
        make the constraints implicit to the user. </p>
      <p>Second, I let the application make some decisions based on hierarchy and the user's selection order. For
        example: When a user selects transparencies, 2-sided printing and stapling is automatically turned off. </p>
      <p>Third, we developed a new form of context
        sensitive help <a
          href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;S1=06134019&amp;OS=06134019&amp;RS=06134019"
          target="_blank">(patented)</a> described below.
        This was designed to be
        unobtrusive, rather than popping a dialog up
        whenever the user changed an affected selection. </p>

      <h3>Innovation and Imitation</h3>
      <p>Typical user interfaces offer no way to discover why a feature or option may be disabled, nor what to do to
        restore the feature. </p>
      <p>One of the innovations I evaluated for the Xerox driver was a special method of constraint handling. If a
        feature or option is grayed out, a small button will appear next to the control. Clicking the button displays a
        message explaining the reason for the constraint and how to enable the feature. </p>

      <h4>The innovation</h4>
      <p>The original design used icons to indicate constraint conditions. But during usability testing, few users
        clicked on the icons. When we changed them to 3D button shapes, most users clicked on them and they improved
        usability of those constrained features. </p>

      <h4>The imitation</h4>
      <p>Soon after the drivers were released, HP introduced a suspiciously similar feature for their drivers. However,
        the HP version used icons and not buttons. Fortunately, Xerox had applied to patent our design and this played a
        significant role in ongoing IP negotiations. </p>
