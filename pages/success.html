            <h1>Increasing Success</h1>
            <p class="small">Coupa | Lead Design | 2022</p>
            <p>Coupa makes it possible for purchasers and suppliers to connect and do business. We had a problem that suppliers often failed to complete their profile and so were unable to conduct business with purchasers.</p>
            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <p>The onboarding process involved providing info regarding business, financial, shipping, banking, identity, diversity and more. Our research found that all but the smallest businesses <em>required information from several people or departments in order to complete the onboarding.</em> Once left incomplete, the missing information was sometimes never completed.</p>
            <h2>Workflow</h2>

            <p>We needed to ask multiple questions for onboarding. </p>
              <ul>
                <li>My first instinct was to simplify by removing questions. Unfortunately, all of the questions were necessary to do business. </li>
                <li>We couldn't allow any one question to block the rest, so allowing the user to skip questions was essential. </li>
                <li>I provided a method for users to skip steps. </li>
                <li>Based on our research, I made it easy to forward unanswered questions directly to a colleague. </li>
              </ul>
            <h2>Details</h2>
            <p>Choosing a "Skip" link below the Next button would show a menu to skip or forward to a colleague. Forwarding would open a message in your default email client &mdash; so the message would come from you, not the app.</p>
