      <h1>Best Laid Plans</h1>
      <div class="entry-content">
        <p>One of the most pressing problem in using cloud computing services is the proper allocation of costs to those that are responsible for rescue usage. A single resource may be shared across departments or customers.  Questions arise about who should pay for setup costs or receive discounts when these are charged.</p>
        <p>CloudCheckr&rsquo;s Billing Plans/Billing Settings enables cloud service providers to create their own showback or chargeback scheme, independent of cloud providers&rsquo; discounts and tiers. This functionality allows companies to allocate costs based on usage, enabling service providers to control margin. The new design changed the app from a monitoring tool into a cash-flow machine.  </p>

          <h3>Legacy Design</h3>
          <p>Despite its complexity, the old design allowed only simple charges to be added, one account at a time and did not scale well to managing multiple accounts. </p>

        <h2 class="">Research</h2>
        <p>User interviews and feature analysis revealed that the legacy design did not offer enough flexibility. Most customers were not able to achieve their desired charge-back schemes using the simple tools we gave them. We found that they needed not just one set of rules but multiple rule-sets to apply to different types of customers. Additionally, they needed to be able to make exceptions based individually negotiated contracts. </p>
        <h2 class="">New Design</h2>
        <p>Instead of just creating one default set of rules for all accounts, users needed the ability to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Create billing rules to transform specific charges via markup, discounts, fees charges and credits, etc. Each with an expiration date</li>
        <li>Allow the creation of collections of these rules that can be assigned to more than one customer</li>
        <li>Allowing ordering and re-ordering of the plans and the rules within each plan so they execute in a specific sequence.</li>
        <li>Allow some customers or accounts to be excepted from each rule while remaining in the same plan. </li>
        <li>And many more detailed complexities</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="">Progressive disclosure</h2>
        <p>Our approach was to provide a concise summary of the settings on each screen, reducing the need for further navigation. This ensures that a powerful concept remains easy to understand and utilize.</p>

        <p class="">The new design listed sets of charges (called plans) rather than individual items. The billing plans page prominently displays the details of each plan, ensuring clarity at the highest level.</p>

        <p class="">Within each billing plan, users can effortlessly edit or rearrange rules. The details of each rule are clearly visible at this level.</p>

        <p class="">Users can assign accounts, exceptions, objectives, and conditions to each rule.</p>

            <h2 class="">Exceptions</h2>
            <p>Each rule allowed exceptions per account Family, and account number within families. This allowed fine control over which discounts and charges would be applied.</p>

        <h2 class="">Billing Settings</h2>
        <p>In addition to the plans and rules, We needed to allow the unbundling of costs, enabling different customers or departments to be billed based on their individual usage rather than relying on a single payer.</p>
