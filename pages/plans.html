      <p class="small">CloudCheckr/NetApp | Lead Design | 2021</p>
      <p>A key challenge in cloud computing is allocating costs to responsible parties, especially when resources are shared across departments or customers. As the lead designer, I collaborated with a PM, dev team, and a UX designer I mentored to redefine CloudCheckr&lsquo;s Billing Plans/Billing Settings. Our goals were to improve cost allocation, scale to multiple accounts, enable reuse of chargeback schemas, and enhance ease of use. This redesign transformed the app from a monitoring tool into a flexible billing solution, exciting early customers and influencing AWS&lsquo;s &lsquo;AWS Billing Conductor&lsquo; a year later.</p>

      <h2>New Design</h2>
      <p>I led the design to provide a concise summary of settings on each screen, reducing navigation needs and ensuring usability. My workflow definition, refined with team input, drove this approach.</p>

      <p>The legacy design was limited, allowing only simple charges per account and struggling to scale.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Supported one account at a time, with no multi-account management.</li>

      <p>I led research through customer interviews and help-desk expert discussions, uncovering:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The legacy design lacked flexibility for diverse chargeback needs.</li>
        <li>Customers required multiple rule-sets for different account types.</li>
        <li>Exceptions based on negotiated contracts were essential.</li>

      <h2>OOUX Breakdown</h2>
      <p>The legacy design had no concept of multiple “plans” or the ability to tailor rules and exceptions to specific account families; everything was hard-coded at a global level.</p>
      <p>To untangle this and chart a clearer path forward, I retroactively built an Object-Oriented UX matrix that reimagined the domain around real objects (Billing Plans, Rules, Exceptions, Account Families, Accounts, and Payers). Mapping the relationships and metadata this way immediately exposed why the old system felt so brittle: there was no object for a “plan” in the first place, so every customization required hacks and one-off exceptions.</p>
      <p>Creating the matrix after the fact was challenging, yet it crystallised the core innovation the product desperately needed: introduce distinct Billing Plans that a Payer can assign to different Account Families, with inheritable Rules and per-account Exceptions. Once that object model existed on paper, the path to a flexible, scalable, and far less overwhelming experience became obvious. The matrix didn’t just document complexity; it revealed the exact where we could simplify it for users and future-proof it for developers.</p>

      <h2>Progressive Disclosure</h2>
      <p>To meet user needs, I designed a system allowing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Creation of billing rules for charges, discounts, fees, and credits with expiration dates.</li>
        <li>Grouping rules for assignment to multiple accounts.</li>
        <li>Reordering plans and rules for sequential execution.</li>
        <li>Exempting specific accounts from rules within the same plan.</li>
        <li>Support for additional complex scenarios.</li>
