            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I&apos;m a Rochester, NY based designer who loves to use design to make people&apos;s work lives easier
                and
                more
                fulfilling.</p>
            <p>I&apos;ve always found my interests at the intersection of technology and art, long before discovering
                the
                field of industrial design â€” filling childhood notebooks with spaceships and other imagined drawings. As
                digital experiences emerged, I found my human-centered design skills seamlessly translated into the UX
                realm. </p>
            <p>The most rewarding part of my work is solving real human problems through innovative yet simple design
                solutions. I find deep satisfaction in observing and deeply understanding people&apos;s needs, then
                applying
                an iterative process to create innovative solutions that remove frustrations and enrich people&apos;s
                working
                lives. Stripping away complexities to deliver purposeful tools that make work more effortless is what
                drives my passion.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I prioritize quality time with family and friends - the core relationships that ground
                me. My passion for creating doesn&apos;t stop at work, however. I find fulfillment in hands-on making
                through
                carpentry, 3D printing, CNC milling, and other outlets for bringing ideas into physical reality.
                Personal projects allow me to hone my skills in an explorative, low-stakes environment. This mindset of
                craftsmanship provides wonderful balance to digital design work.</p>
