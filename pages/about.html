            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I&apos;m a Rochester, NY based designer who loves to use design to make people&apos;s work lives easier
                and
                more
                fulfilling.</p>
            <p>I&apos;ve always found my interests at the intersection of technology and art, long before I became an Industrial Designer â€” even as a kid, I filled notebooks with drawings of the future. As digital experiences emerged, I found my human-centered design skills seamlessly translated into the UX realm. </p>
            <p>The most rewarding part of my work is solving real human problems through innovative yet simple design
                solutions. I find deep satisfaction in observing and deeply understanding people&apos;s needs, then
                applying
                an iterative process to create innovative solutions that remove frustrations and enrich people&apos;s
                working
                lives. Stripping away complexities to deliver purposeful tools that make work more effortless is what
                drives my passion.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I prioritize quality time with family and friends - the core relationships that ground
                me. My passion for creating doesn&apos;t stop at work, however. I find fulfillment in hands-on making
                through
                carpentry, 3D printing, CNC milling, and other outlets for bringing ideas into physical reality.
                Personal projects allow me to hone my skills in an explorative, low-stakes environment. This mindset of
                craftsmanship provides wonderful balance to digital design work.</p>

            <h2>Innovation</h2>
            <p>Innovation unlocks new possibilities. I explore ways to leverage tech solutions to eliminate
              unnecessary work or transform existing processes.

            <p>Simplicity, without innovation to enable it, may make a design look nice but perform poorly. I focus
