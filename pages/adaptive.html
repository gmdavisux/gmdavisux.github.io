      <p class="small">Xerox | Strategy Team Member | 2004</p>
      <p>As part of the strategy team that created the style guide, one task was to help determine how to adapt the UI
        strategic design to several different embedded display sizes.</p>
      <p>A main goal of the strategic design group was coherence across products. The same design had to be scaled to fit
        anything from the largest full-screen displays to the smallest quarter-panel devices. This had to be done while
        maintaining the a usable touch-target size and readable font size. This allows a coherent user-experience across
        all levels of devices. </p>

      <h2>Graceful Adaptation</h2>
      <p>Shown are large 4:3 aspect ratio display (both 10-inch and 8-inch), 7-inch 16:9 aspect ratio displays,
        half-panel, and quarter-panel touch displays. All displays met the requirements for touch-target size and font
        readability. The UI architecture is similar to allow the transfer of learning and a common user experience. </p>
      <p>At that time, most of our displays (embedded or client) supported 12-bit (2096 colors) or more. The strategic UI design
        elements were designed for full-color.</p>

      <h2>16-grays</h2>
      <p>Before the transition to the full-color screens Xerox employs today, most displays utilized only 16-gray
        levels. Through the skillful use of dithering and other techniques, I was able to adapt the strategic design
        elements to this display technology.</p>

      <h2>4-grays</h2>
      <p>Some of the earlier touch screens used only black, white, and two shades of gray. I was able to gracefully
        degrade strategic design elements to these parameters.</p>
