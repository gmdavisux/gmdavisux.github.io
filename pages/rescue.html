            <p class="small">Kodak Alaris | Lead Design, Research Planning and Facilitation | 2015</p>
            <p>We needed to turn an engineering prototype into a product with an aggressive schedule. Resource constraints threatened to push back design changes until after release.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I was able to convince developers to allow me access to source code and make only CSS and HTML changes to transform the appearance without changing the existing back-end code.</p>

            <h2>New Design</h2>
            <p>I was able to transform the appearance to a finished product. I used mostly CSS to transform the appearance. I also implemented HTML and C++ changes when necessary.</p>
            <p>For testing and communication, I also created an <a href="proto/" target="_blank">interactive prototype</a> using html, css, and angular.js <a href="proto/" target="_blank">Try it!</a></p>

            <p>We started with the engineering prototype. We developed a completely different design and workflow. All of this was out of scope for initial launch.</p>

            <p>The icons and colors of the app were designed to look good on the control panel, which I knew was being redesigned.  (I didn&rsquo;t design the scanner or it&rsquo;s control panel) </p>
