      <h1>Visual Retro</h1>
      <p class="small">Xerox | UI Designer | 2000 - 2006</p>
      <p>In the early days of my design journey, I had the opportunity to delve into the world of creating icons, graphics, and animations for user interfaces. These artifacts, though visually distinct from today's design standards, hold a special place in my portfolio as they represent the starting point of my creative exploration.
      </p>
      <p>While the aesthetics may appear dated through a contemporary lens, these early works showcase my ability to
        adapt and thrive within the technical confines of the era. They serve as a testament to my resourcefulness and
        creative problem-solving skills, as well as my willingness to embrace new challenges.</p>
      <p>Revisiting these retro graphics not only sparks a sense of nostalgia but also highlights the remarkable
        evolution of design and technology over the years. They stand as a reminder of the ever-changing nature of our
        industry and the importance of continuous learning and growth.</p>
      <p>As you explore this section of my portfolio, I invite you to appreciate these early endeavors not merely for
        their visual appeal but for the journey they represent &mdash; a journey that has shaped my design sensibilities and
        paved the way for the more sophisticated and polished work that followed.</p>

      <h2>Animated Fault Graphics </h2>
      <p>Every paper jam needs instructions and graphics to help the user clear it. I personally have created hundreds
        of these images and helped write the accompanying messages.</p>
      <p>Here are just a few examples. </p>

      <p>Crafted nearly two decades ago, these graphic elements were shaped by the technological limitations of the
        time. Limited color palettes and display constraints required a strategic approach to convey information and
        enhance the user experience within those boundaries.</p>

      <h2>Icons</h2>
      <p>I have designed thousands of icons and graphics over the course of the ten years or so that I was at
        Xerox. Here are some examples.</p>

      <h3>16-color icons </h3>
      <p>Back in the day, windows apps safely supported only 16-colors. (Not 16-bit but 16 specific colors) When there were multiple versions of windows around, we had to design to the lowest common denominator (windows 3.1) and stick with the 16-colors so code did not need to be recompiled and re-tested. </p>
