        <h1>Replenishing Suppliers</h1>
            <p>Coupa provides business spend management solutions that  manage transactions between buyers and sellers. The purchasing side of the software got all the attention while the supplier side was a little neglected.</p>

            <p>The legacy landing page for suppliers offered very little actionable content. Suppliers immediately left this page looking for actual work to be done. </p>

            <h2 class="">Research</h2>
            
            <p>A dedicated UX researcher conducted extensive interviews regarding the legacy design and some proposed changes.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Suppliers of all sizes explained they did not spend much time on the legacy dashboard because there was no action to take there and content rarely changed.</li>
                <li>Larger suppliers universally complained about the fact that the legacy design allowed them to view only one customer&apos;s orders and invoices at a time. This meant they needed to check each customer (which could be hundreds) to make sure they do not miss important tasks. </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="">New design &mdash; A Better place to begin</h2>
            <p>From the discussion with suppliers, it was obvious we needed the homepage to direct users to work that needs to be done. </p>
            
            <img src="https://usersimple.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/final-with-side-announcements-1.png?w=1024" alt="" class="img-fluid border" >
            
            <ul>
                <li>We started with a recent activity table that would display orders, invoices and requests that needed attention. </li>
                <li>Announcements are improved and used to communicate from customers to all Coupa suppliers. Incorporating announcements into the homepage increases their visibility. </li>
                <li>A search preview highlights the suppliers prominence in search and helps them improve.</li>
                <li>Improved navigation aligns the styles of the supplier portal to the rest of Coupa&apos;s suite. </li>
                <li>The supplier&apos;s company name and profile completion are prominent at the top of the page.</li>
                <li>An additional set of less common status items are also listed below.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="">World View</h3>
            <p>Based on the research above, we discovered suppliers strongly preferred all their accounts in one list. I proposed the possibility of displaying information from multiple customer accounts. </p>
            <p>Differing regional data privacy laws around the world presented a challenge to gather all the data at once as it needs to be stored in the country of origin. Although there was initial resistance to the difficulty of the task, the research helped convince the team that this was a problem worth being solved. </p>
