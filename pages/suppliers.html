            <p>Coupa provides business spend management solutions that manage transactions between buyers and sellers.</p>
            <p>As the principal and only designer, I collaborated with the product manager and development team to 
                revamp the supplier side of this B2B purchasing software. Leveraging a pre-existing design system and 
                strategy, we addressed a neglected user experience to boost engagement on a frequently skipped login page.</p>

            <h2 class="">New design &mdash; work to be done!</h2>
            <p>From our discussions with suppliers, we learned most users skipped the old landing page due to its lack of actionable content. I led the redesign to create an intuitive hub:</p>

                <li>Introduced a recent activity table to display orders and announcements. </li>
                <li>Streamlined announcements for clarity and user action. </li>
                <li>Enhanced supplier visibility in search and profile completion.</li>
                <li>Improved navigation aligns the styles of the supplier portal to the rest of Coupa&apos;s suite.</li>
                <li>Aligned with Coupas&apos; design system for consistency. This overhaul aimed to increase user engagement, a key goal since users typically bypassed this page post-login.</li>

            <h2 class="">Research</h2>
            <p>A dedicated UX researcher conducted extensive interviews, revealing</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Suppliers of all sizes rarely spent time on the legacy page due to no clear next steps.</li>
                <li>Content rarely changed, reducing relevance.</li>
                <li>Design allowed only one customer&apos;s facts and invoices at a time, limiting efficiency.
My world view analysis proposed consolidating supplier accounts into one list, improving task access. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="">World View</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Research showed suppliers strongly preferred having all their accounts in one list. I proposed displaying information from multiple customer accounts.</li>
                <li>Differing regional data privacy laws presented a challenge, as data needs to be stored in the country of origin.</li>
                <li>Although there was initial resistance due to the difficulty, research helped convince the team this was a problem worth solving.</li>

            <h2>Legacy Design</h2>
            <p>The legacy landing page for suppliers offered minimal actionable content, prompting immediate exits as users sought real work. It was poorly designed with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Competing visual elements causing confusion.</li>
                <li>Stale data that rarely updated.</li>
                <li>Empty profile info users never completed.</li>
