            <p>Xerox systems have the potential to require several different bits of information to use some of their
                systems, related to various forms of authentication, access or accounting. Although some customers
                wanted to utilize more than one method, the volume of user input required made this unusable.</p>

                <div class="col-lg-12">
                    <p>We proposed a design that unified all methods allowing a logical approach to machine access and accounting that is highly coherent and simple to use. By associating authentication names with accounts, and remembering static information, the number of screens and the workflow was significantly improved.</p>

            <p>Accounting however, may be required on a per job basis, such as charging to a specific client. The user will be
